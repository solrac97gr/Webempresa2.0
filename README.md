<h2 align="center">Websigth | Closed</h2>

Web created for a small development agency that I did a while ago. It is no longer operational but I keep it with love.Interesting things I learned in this project was to connect a web form with a google form, to solve the problem of not having backend since it was hosted on github and at that time I did not know serverless.
